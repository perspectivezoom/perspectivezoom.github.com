Berkeley versus Stanford
========================

As a graduate of both UC Berkeley and Stanford University, I have been occassionally asked to compare the two. My response, one that has developed from these inquiries over the years, has become quite complicated.

The first thing to point out is that this was hardly a scientific experiment. I entered both universities at very different times in my life, with different goals, for different reasons. 

I went to Berkeley for four years, from the ages of 16 to 20, to grow as a person and learn some hard engineering. I cooked for the first time and studied everything from metal corrosion to biostatistics to Fourier transforms.

I attended Stanford two years later for 1.25 years, less than a third of my stint at Berkeley, and primarily as a way to expand my future career opportunities. I gave double the presentations than I'd ever done in my life, learned a lot of Excel, and soaked in a firehose of business strategy and customer development.

It is easy to see why I hold a much deeper loyalty to my undergraduate alma mater; I held much deeper friendships for much longer, and I just plain had more fun there. At Stanford, my friends were older. They were more mercenary. They were more professional. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure that while I was at Stanford there were tons of people that bleached 25 nerdy Halloween pumpkin carvings or memorized the dance for OK Go's A Million Ways. It's just that they were probably undergrads too.

And so, when asked to compare the two, my almost-complete answer is that it just isn't apples to apples. Sounds like a cop-out, doesn't it? Except, well, I haven't finished yet.

I traveled back to Berkeley during my third quarter at Stanford, to visit some friends. I waited for them near Telegraph and Durant, on the south side of campus. I waited for only five minutes, but in those five minutes more people crossed that street than would two hour's worth of foot traffic at Stanford. That night, I cut across campus, north to south. At around nine o'clock, in front of Dwinelle Hall, I stop for a group of 30 doing Polynesian dancing. A hundred steps later, in front of Sproul Hall, I witness a dozen people playing Taiko drums. I had forgotten the sheer variety of stuff that happened at Berkeley, and how it always felt like it was bursting at the seams. It was the effect of stuffing thirty thousand people in half a square mile, roughly double that of Stanford in one tenth of the space.

At Stanford, all but three of my classes had group projects. Each one required presentations and/or reports, tailored to both fictional and real clients. I had one class fly me to Hong Kong and Macau, for a 15 minute presentation. I had in depth discussions with living legends. At Stanford, I acquired a broadened awareness that I would never have gotten at Berkeley. And to acquire that post-annealed tempering, it only cost me the equivalent of four year's tuition at Berkeley.

I never had the opportunity to choose, but you can imagine an alternate universe, where there is a version of me that also attended UC Berkeley and Stanford, but in the opposite order. I am damn lucky that I'm not him.

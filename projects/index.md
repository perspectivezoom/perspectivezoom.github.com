Projects
========

Gmailytics
----------
[source](https://github.com/bcamarda/gmailytics)

Gmailytics was a web app that visualizes your gmail account, providing such statistics as a graph of the volume of email received per hour of the day or a word cloud of the most common words found in your email. It was created as a 4 person final project for [Dev Bootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com). Before using it for yourself, please note that this app was abandoned prior to the major [January 2013 Rails vulnerability](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/) and has not been patched. 

Code that I worked on:
* OAuth authentication
* IMAP email parsing
* The D3 word cloud
* Account deletion and obsfucation
* The polling cycle
